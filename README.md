# CPU-Scheduling
Variety of CPU Scheduling Algorithms, both pre-emptive and non-preemptive, with Average Statistics calculation
The following CPU scheduling Algorithms are covered:                                                                           
1.)First Come First Served                                                                                                      
2.)Shortest Job First ( Pre Emptive )
3.)Longest Job First                                                                                                        
4.)Longest Remaining Time First ( Pre Emptive)                                                                             
5.)Round Robin Scheduling                                                                    
6.)Priority Based Scheduling                                                                                          
The input format is very simple, enter the process ID and their Arrival Time and Burst Times.
The Scheduler will automatically, sort the Arrival Times and give a Tabular Representation of the Waiting Time and Turn Around Time with the average statistics.
